<p> You're given a singly linked list sorted in ascending order like <code> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5</code> </p>

<p> You have to remove all the duplicates from the sorted list and return a sorted singly linked list with distinct nodes like <code> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 </code></p>
<br/>
<p> Note there were two 1's and two 2's and we removed both of them.</p>
