<p>Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,</p>

<p>add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).</p>

<p>The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>If the vector has <code class="highlighter-rouge">[1, 2, 3]</code></p>

<p>the returned vector should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">[1, 2, 4]</code></p>

<p>as <code class="highlighter-rouge">123 + 1 = 124</code>.</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which you should practice asking the interviewer.<br />
For example, for this problem, following are some good questions to ask :</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Q :</strong> Can the input have 0’s before the most significant digit. Or in other words, is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0 1 2 3</code> a valid input?</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>A :</strong> For the purpose of this question, <strong>YES</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Q :</strong> Can the output have 0’s before the most significant digit? Or in other words, is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0 1 2 4</code> a valid output?</li>
    <li><strong>A :</strong> For the purpose of this question, <strong>NO</strong>. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.</li>
  </ul>
