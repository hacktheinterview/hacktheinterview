<p>Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.</p>

<p>A valid IP address must be in the form of A.B.C.D, where A,B,C and D are numbers from 0-255. The numbers cannot be 0 prefixed unless they are 0.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Given “25525511135”,</p>

<p>return [“255.255.11.135”, “255.255.111.35”]. (Make sure the returned strings are sorted in order)</p>
