<p> Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. </p>
<p> Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes. </p>

<p> You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

Input: <code> 1->2->3->4->5->NULL </code> <br/>
Output: <code> 1->3->5->2->4->NULL. </code> <br/>
