<p>You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.</p>

<p>Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.</p>

<p>Return A and B.</p>

<p>Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?</p>

<p>Note that in your output A should precede B.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<code>Input:[3 1 2 5 3]</code></br>
<code>Output:[3, 4]</code></br>
<code>A = 3, B = 4</code></br>
