<p>A robot is located at the top-left corner of an <strong>A x B grid</strong> (marked ‘Start’ in the diagram below).</p>

<p>The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked ‘Finish’ in the diagram below).</p>

<p>How many possible unique paths are there?</p>

<p><em>Note: A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer.</em></p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Input : A = 2, B = 2
Output : 2

2 possible routes : (0, 0) -&gt; (0, 1) -&gt; (1, 1)
              OR  : (0, 0) -&gt; (1, 0) -&gt; (1, 1)
</code></pre>
</div>
