<p> Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, </p>
<p> add 1 to the number (increment the number represented by the digits). </p>
<p> The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list. </p>
<br/>
<p>Example:</p>
<p> If the vector has <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> </p>
<p> the returned vector should be  <code>[1, 2, 4]</code> </p>
<p>as 123 + 1 = 124</p>
